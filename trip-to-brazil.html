                        <p>
                          Due to the current crisis, we are planning a workshop
                          trip to Tenerife in 2022. Estimated date between 19.2.
                          and 3.3.2022. If you are interested, please
                          <a href="#footer">contact us</a> (limited number of
                          participants). We will then add you to our mailing
                          list and will then inform you about the status of the
                          planning and the process.

                        The trip to Brazil 2020 from January 25th to February
                        9th and 02/16/2020 took place as planned.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The trip takes place in the pre-Carnival period. All
                        groups prepare for the carnival, rehearsals, concerts,
                        festivals. The best travel time for those interested in
                        percussion. The base of the trip is 2 weeks in Bahia. A
                        3rd week is on offer. The 3rd week depends on your
                        interests. Again the beach, in the mountains. Due to the
                        tense security situation, Rio de Janeiro is not part of
                        the program at the moment. But that can still change.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The number of participants is limited. I try to align my
                        planning according to your wishes. Bahia Connection
                        workshops are planned for 6 days in Salvador da Bahia.
                        If you organize your trip yourself, you can take part in
                        the workshops if you register in advance.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This is a trip that will allow you to get to know a lot
                        of the Afro-Brazilian culture. But being close to
                        cultural life also means that the power goes out, the
                        bus doesn't leave on time or something doesn't work the
                        way you want it to. Everything has its 2 sides. Often
                        times, perfection is sterile. Creativity and joie de
                        vivre usually arise from chaos. Under no circumstances
                        do I want to have participants who are entitled to a
                        package tour such as. come from TUI or similar tour
                        operators. So if you are too sensitive or demanding, you
                        should avoid my offer. But if you are there, you get
                        insights that a package tour traveler can only dream of.
                        Based on my long experience, I will prepare everything
                        as well as possible so that we can have it as pleasantly
                        as possible. On this video you get a few impressions, it
                        takes place in Salvador da Bahia, Chapada Diamantina
                        (mountains) and Imbassai (beach) Travel impressions
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I am not a tour operator. I do the reservations in
                        Brazil and design the program. My care begins when you
                        arrive in Brazil. You have to book flights etc.
                        yourself.

                        <h3>Two and three week trips to Brazil</h3>
                      </header>
                      <p>
                        Many years ago, many inquiries from friends and
                        musicians prompted me to offer trips to Brazil. These
                        trips are aimed at all those interested in culture and
                        include a two or three week program in Bahia / Brazil,
                        depending on the planning with Rio de Janeiro. Since
                        2005 I have planned and carried out a number of trips.
                        Some of the participants have already been there several
                        times. I can proudly say that none of my participants
                        was attacked or robbed while I was taking care of them.
                        The participants also enjoyed the program very much and
                        enabled them to immerse themselves deeply in Brazilian
                        culture.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I can also organize a trip for your samba group
                        according to your wishes. In 2007 I accompanied a group
                        from Hamburg.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This travel offer is aimed at everyone who is actively
                        interested in Afro-Brazilian culture beyond banal
                        clichés: drummers, dancers, capoeiristas. In addition to
                        beach holidays and relaxation in the mountains, we
                        encounter the fascinating world of Afro-Brazilian
                        culture. Local native speaking guides guarantee deep
                        immersion in the vibrant pre-Carnival period in Salvador
                        and Rio. Optional workshops and other activities are
                        offered; However, these are not a focus of the trip, so
                        you can confidently take your family, boyfriend or
                        girlfriend with you.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Bahia has a lot more to offer than you can experience as
                        an individual tourist when you travel the country with
                        local and linguistic guides. Visits to the Afro-Blocos
                        in Salvador / Bahia, a percussion workshop with Mestres
                        of the great Afro-Blocos (Olodum, Ilê Aiyê, Muzenza,
                        Malêdebalê) are planned. There are also trips to dream
                        beaches.
                      </p>
                      <p>According to your wishes, on offer:</p>
                      <p>
                        A trip to the "Chapada Diamantina", a picturesque
                        mountain region with waterfalls, caves and a visit to
                        the former gem town of Lencois.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In Rio we will visit sights like Corcovado or Sugar
                        Loaf. Of course, the rehearsals of the samba schools and
                        the wide range of cultural events will not be neglected.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I want to keep the costs as low as possible. That is why
                        there are no 4-star hotels, but clean, friendly pousadas
                        (guest houses) with breakfast.
